# jQuery Homework

Be sure that you open the index.html file in your browser, and don't edit it.
Open the [exercise/index.html](exercise/index.html) here.

There are ten questions inside of the main.js file [exercise/js/main.js](exercise/js/main.js). We want you to answer all of these inside the js file we've provided, and there is an already made HTML and CSS file for you all. You should not edit the HTML or CSS, or the images. Use jQuery to complete each question, and try to use every resource available on the internet to  help you.

Here are some resources we'll give you that will definitely help:
